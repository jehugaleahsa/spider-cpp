#spider-cpp

##Dependencies
spider-cpp is dependent on **Boost 1.53**. It requires access to the libraries:
* boost asio
* boost regex
* boost system

spider-cpp was compiled on Ubuntu 12/Slackware 14 with g++-4.8.1 installed. It was written using VIM. I used GNU make to automate my builds.

##Usage
Assuming you have boost installed under `/usr`, the following should build and run the spider:
    make extractor SITE=root_url DIR=download_directory

## Purpose
The hope is that, given a URL, the code will eventually extract additional URLs from the resultant HTML. From those URLs, more pages will be extracted. This process should continue until all unique URLs are visited (this could take a while). Additionally, URLs referring to certain types of resources (movies, images, etc.) will be downloaded to a local file.

## TODO
These are the tasks I have to do yet.
* Handle SSL handshaking.
* Spit out download progress to the command line as streaming text.

## What I've Learned So Far
I came into this project completely inexperienced writing realistic applications with C++. Previously, I only wrote simple command-line applications that worked within the STL. That means no database access, no network access and almost no file system access. Already, I have learned a lot about writing realistic C++ applications. It has made me more appreciative of how hard it can be to write large scale software in such a low-level language. Amongst the things I have learned, here is a short list:

* make files are a lot of work.
* separate compilation allows pushing off linking until the last second.
* Boost's unit testing framework is pretty awesome, but relies on macros.
* working with Git on the command-line isn't that bad.
* Boost's asio library is a very low-level abstraction of the underlyiung socket libraries.
* argument checking in C++ is annoying and creating custom exceptions is even more annoying.
* it is hard to tell when to return `std::string` vs. `const char *`.
* I find myself reaching for Boost more often than I thought I would.
* having implementation (.cpp) in a separate file than the declaration (.hpp) takes longer and requires more memorization.
* almost never use `using namespace xyz;` (using directive); limit yourself to using declarations within functions.
* template members must be implemented in the header files (since export doesn't work).
* inline functions must be implemented in the header files, too.
* prefer taking a templated destination iterator over a collection to populate.
* always check whether a constructor takes a value or a reference type.
* when you can't figure out the cause of a segmentation fault, use gdb.
* the iostream library is extremely powerful and flexible at the same time.
* `fstream` only accepts `char *` for file names.
* `fstream` doesn't recognize `~` and other special path indicators. No exceptions thrown.
* prior to C++ 11, default function template arguments weren't allowed.
* template member functions lead to ugly syntax, in many cases.
* Boost and C++11's function template simplifies working with threads.
* C++11's regex doesn't support named capture groups.
* C++11's `bind` can't easily be negated. Boost's `bind` could be proceeded by `!`.
* inheriting from types in the `<functional>` header is painful. Use `ptr_fun`, etc. when possible.
* because `std::exception`\`s `what` method returns `char const *`, returning the results of `c_str` on a locally built error string is a bug. The message must be built within the ctor.
* there may be some value in creating simple wrapper classes around primitive types to make sure they are given the same treatment as user-defined types within ctors.
* Boost's `bind` function can save from creating lots of little functor classes.
* Polymorphism can rarely be used with references; pointers work more naturally.
* There's not a convenient formatting for ctors withlots of parameters or long initializer lists.
* Don't pass `shared_ptr` to lambda by reference!
* C++11 threads call `terminate` when deconstructed, unless detached.
